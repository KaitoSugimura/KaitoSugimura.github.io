            On paper, I am a Software Engineer. But if you get to know me,
            you'll know I am just a hobbiest who simply enjoys programming and
            creating new things.
            <br /><br />Growing up, I've always been into video games,
            especially ones created by a game company called Nintendo. I
            remember the joy and fun I had playing games such as, Pok√©mon,
            Mario, Kirby, and many other famous titles. It was what let me
            explore many fantasies, or solve different types of puzzles. I still
            remember to this day, the feeling of waiting till Christmas or my
            Birthday for my parents to buy me the newest game. It was truly what
            brought delight and happiness into my world. <br /><br />That is why
            my dream is to become a engineer/developer that would do the same
            and bring a smile to another persons face. To be bluntly honest,
            until recently, I never really fully understood what it meant to be
            a software engineer, in fact I initially chose this degree out of
            spite thinking it was just computer related. But right now, I am
            glad to be where I am and I can confidently say, this is where I
            belong. Coding can be challenging or even frusterating at times, but
            the satisfaction of clicking compile and having no errors can never
            be beaten.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">My definition of Engineer</h3>
          <p class="about-engineer">
            A Scientist is someone who wishes to learn more about the world. To
            seek the truth by creating theories and testing hypotheses.
            <br />
            An Engineer is someone who utilizes that knowledge and discovery. To
            materialize science into something that can be used by the common
            good.
            <br /><br />
            My goal as an Software Engineer is to help create a
            Game/Program/Product that would give off the same joy and happiness
            I once had as a child playing video games. Something that is Fun for
            Everyone.
